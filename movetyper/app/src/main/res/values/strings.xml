    <string name="instructions">Welcome to Movable Typer! This application allows you to try the Motion
    Input Keyboard. When selected, a ball appears which indicates the direction in which the device\'s
    motion has been recognized (based on the sensitivity level set in the settings). To get the
    tired emoji, shake the device to the left or the right (which will make the ball bounce from left
    to right). To get the laughing emoji, move the device up or down (which will make the ball bounce
    up and down). To get the thinking emoji, change the device\'s position (move the whole device
    forward, backward, upward or downward, which will make the ball perform a pulse animation).
    The picked up motion will reflect on the ball\'s movement and a feedback vibration. The sensitivity
    can be set by pushing the "Settings" button (default is 25 m/s^2). Try it out below (remember to
    set your keyboard to Motion Input)</string>
